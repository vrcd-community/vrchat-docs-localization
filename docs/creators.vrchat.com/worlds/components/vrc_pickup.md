| Momentum Transfer Method         | This defines how the collision force will be added to the other object which was hit, using Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition.<br />Note: the force will only be added if 'AllowCollisionTransfer' is on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Orientation                      | What way the object will be held                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Auto Hold                        | Should the pickup remain in the user's hand after they let go of the grab button.<br />- Auto Detect: Automatically detects what to do<br />- Yes: After the grab button is released the pickup remains in the hand until the drop button is pressed and released<br />- No: After the grab button is released the pickup is let go<br />Note: This only applies to control schemes which lack an independent "Use" input from "Grab", such as Desktop, Vive, and Vive-like input systems. This does not apply to Quest, Quest-like, and other input systems with a defined trigger. |
| Use Text                         | Text that appears when the user has an object equipped, prompting them to "fire" the object.<br />Requires "Auto Hold" to be set to "Yes".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
