# Supported Scripted Assets

You can use certain external assets that use scripts in VRChat worlds.

To see a list of precise components permitted in VRChat worlds, please see [Allowlisted World Components](/creators.vrchat.com/worlds/whitelisted-world-components). Most of these components (except TextMeshPro) are unavailable on Quest.

## TextMeshPro
"TextMesh Pro is the ultimate text solution for Unity. It's the perfect replacement for Unity's UI Text & Text Mesh."

As of Unity 2018, TextMesh Pro is a built-in component of Unity. We strongly recommend TextMeshPro over Unity's built-in text components, as it delivers high-quality text in any font size or screen size.

## Post Processing Stack v2
Import from Package Manager.

We strongly suggest checking out [Silent's Post Processing guide](https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/SCSS/wikis/Other/Post-Processing) for more info and best practices.
::: warning 

Do not import the `Test` folder when importing post-processing. It will cause script errors which will prevent you from uploading the world.
:::
"Post-processing is the process of applying full-screen filters and effects to a cameraâ€™s image buffer before it is displayed to screen. It can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time."

## [Final IK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/final-ik-14290)
"The final Inverse Kinematics solution for the game developer."
